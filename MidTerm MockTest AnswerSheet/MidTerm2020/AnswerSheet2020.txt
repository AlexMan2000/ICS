6.1)All the elements are already in ascending order.
  2)All the elements are in descending order.

Part 3
1.b) O(n^2),for each iteration of elements in the list, we have to find the exact
position it belongs to, which requires another traverse in the sorted part of the list
, so the total runtime is O(n*n) = O(n^2)
2.c) O(1) We only use some variables that hold the integers and we don't use
extra list to accomplish the algorithm. In other words, we modify the list
in place. Therefore, the space complexity is O(1)
