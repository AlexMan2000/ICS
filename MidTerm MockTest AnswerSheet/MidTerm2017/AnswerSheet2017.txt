Part1
1.O(m*n)
2.O((m+n)*logn)
When the length of the list and the search times are both relatively small, then
the first method seems to be better. But normally, we have huge number of items in
the list, and do many times of search, then the second method is absolutely better.


Part2
1.O(1),O(N)
2.(1): O(N)
  (2): O(N^2)
  (3): O(N^2)
3.O(N*logN),O(N*logN)
